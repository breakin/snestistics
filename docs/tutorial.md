These are the posts in the tutorial series. See the [introduction](tutorial-1) for more information!

1. [Introduction](tutorial-1)
2. [First annotations](tutorial-2)

The idea is that we introduce snestistics features when they are needed by RE...

Future posts on snestistics itself (in order of appearance I guess):
* Code prediction
* Trace log
* Auto annotations (helps with trace log, at least when it works)
* Advanced trace-capturing from snes9x (using movies and saves)
* Rewind

Future posts on RE:
* ???
