## Rom
Name | Short | Type | Description
:----|-------|:-----|:-----------
*romfile* | r | input file name | ROM file. Currently only LoROM ROMs are allowed.
*romsize* | rs | integer | Size of ROM cartridge (without header). A value of 0 means auto-detect (which reads the size from tracefiles).
*rommode* | rm | enumeration | Type of ROM.<br><br>**detect**: Detect based on information in .trace-file<br>**lorom**: LoROM (default)<br>**hirom**: HiROM

## Trace
Name | Short | Type | Description
:----|-------|:-----|:-----------
*tracefile* | t | input file name | Trace file from an emulation session. Multiple allowed for assembly source listing (but not trace log or rewind).
*regenerate* | rg | boolean | Regenerate emulation caches. Needs to be run if trace files has been updated.
*predict* | p | enumeration | Predict can add instructions that was not part of the trace by guessing. This setting specify where snestistics is allowed to guess.<br><br>**never**: No prediction<br>**functions**: Only predict within annotated functions (default)<br>**everywhere**: Predict as much as possible

## Assembly Listing
Name | Short | Type | Description
:----|-------|:-----|:-----------
*asmoutfile* | a | output file name | Generated assembly listing.
*asmheaderfile* | ah | input file name | Content of this file will be pasted in the Header section of the generated assembly source listing.
*asmprintpc* | apc | boolean | Print program counter in assembly source listing.
*asmprintbytes* | ab | boolean | Print opcode bytes in assembly source listing.
*asmprintregistersizes* | ars | boolean | Print registers sizes in assembly source listing.
*asmprintdb* | adb | boolean | Print data bank in assembly source listing.
*asmprintdp* | adp | boolean | Print direct page in assembly source listing.
*asmlowercaseop* |  | boolean | Print lower-case opcode in assembly source listing.
*asmcorrectwla* |  | boolean | Make sure generated source compiled in WLA DX.

## Trace Log
Name | Short | Type | Description
:----|-------|:-----|:-----------
*nmifirst* | n0 | integer | First NMI to consider for things that are nmi range based. Currently only affects the trace log.
*nmilast* | n1 | integer | Last NMI to consider for things that are nmi range based. Currently only affects the trace log.
*tracelogoutfile* | tl | output file name | Generated trace log. Nmi range can be controlled using *nmifirst* and *nmilast*. Custom printing can be done using scripting.
*scriptfile* | s | input file name | A squirrel script. See scripting reference in the user guide for entry point functions as well as API specification.

## Annotations
Name | Short | Type | Description
:----|-------|:-----|:-----------
*labelsfile* | l | input file name | A file containing annotations. Custom file format.
*autolabelsfile* | al | input/output file name | A file containing annotations. These are special as it will be regenerated if deleted or if *autoannotate* is specified.
*autoannotate* | aa | boolean | Auto annotate labels. Automatically generate labels in free space (not used by symbols from regular *labelsfile*-files) space and save to *autolabelsfile*. This will also happen if the file specified by *autolabelsfile* is missing.
*symbolfmaoutfile* | sf | output file name | Generated symbols file in FMA format compatible with bsnes-plus.

## Reports
Name | Short | Type | Description
:----|-------|:-----|:-----------
*reportoutfile* | rp | output file name | Generated assembly report. Companion file to *asmoutfile*.

## Rewind
Name | Short | Type | Description
:----|-------|:-----|:-----------
*rewindoutfile* | rw | output file name | Generated rewind report in .DOT file format. Use graphviz to generate PDF/PNG report.
